\begin{abstract}
    According to W3C accessibility standards, most Web applications are neither accessible nor usable for people with disabilities. Developers often solve this problem by building separate accessible applications, but these are seldom usable and typically offer less functionality than the original. Another common solution is to maintain a single application, but create an accessible view by applying on-the-fl transformations to each requested page ― a solution that rarely suits all audiences. A third solution is described here: let users improve Web accessibility in their client browsers through interface refactorings, which offer many customized, accessible views of a single application.通过W3C可访问性标准，大部分Web应用程序对于残疾人群都是不可访问且不可用的。开发者经常通过创建独立的可访问性应用程序来解决这个问题，但是那很少可用，并且通常提供的功能比原来少。另一个常用的解决方法是保持单一的应用程序，但是创建一个可访问性界面
